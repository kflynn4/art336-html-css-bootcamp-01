        <h1>Ducks Unlimited</h1>
        <p>In 1927, an offshoot of the Boone and Crockett Club was created specifically for sport bird management and operated until 1930 as the American Wild Fowlers. This group had such familiar names as Arthur Bartley and Nash Buckingham, who would later be very instrumental in the conservation movement.</p> 
            <p>In 1930, Joseph P. Knapp, a publishing tycoon who successfully obtained such notable publications as The Associated Sunday Magazine, Crowell Publishing Company, Collier’s Weekly, Farm and Fireside and the book publisher P.F. Collier & Sons, founded More Game Birds in America and American Wild Fowlers was quickly absorbed into the new organization. Then in 1937, Knapp, Robert Winthrop, and a small group of conservation philanthropists decided it was time to focus on the decreasing waterfowl populations, and the habitat necessary to sustain them in Canada, and formed Ducks Unlimited, Inc. As had happened before, More Game Birds in America was absorbed by the new waterfowl organization.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>I'm of the opinion that a duck does not change styles every time it crosses a state line. I think they sound the same way from Canada all the way to the coast. As far as championship calling... I realize that a duck <em>could not</em> win a world championship, and that's why I <em>don't</em> do that. When it comes to duck calling, our judges have wings.</p>
            <cite>Jase Robertson</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Ducks Unlimited Canada was then incorporated in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada on March 10, 1937. Other chapters have since begun operation in Latin America, Mexico, New Zealand, and Australia.</p>
        <p>DU has become a leader in waterfowl habitat conservation and has conserved more than 12.8 million acres (46,900 km²) of waterfowl habitat in North America. DU partners with a wide range of corporations, governments, other non-governmental organizations, landowners, and private citizens to restore and manage areas that have been degraded and to prevent further degradation of existing wetlands.</p>
            <p>DU is also active in working with others to recommend government policies that will positively influence wetlands and the environment. DU generates $180 million in revenues each year, of which a minimum of 80 percent goes directly towards habitat conservation. Their sources of revenue include Federal and State habitat reimbursements (37%), conservation easements (13%), sponsors and members (24%), major gifts and donations (21%) and royalties/advertisement (5%). Through its conservation activities, DU benefits biodiversity, water quality, the environment, and the economy in the areas in which it is active.</p>
        <h2>Conservation</h2>
        <p>Traditionally, most DU wetland conservation projects were conducted on waterfowl breeding areas in the Canadian prairies by its subsidiary, Ducks Unlimited Canada (DUC). DUC has however expanded its operations to include projects in every Canadian province and territory, not just in the prairies. DU has also expanded its operations to include conservation projects in every state of the United States and in Mexico. It retains primary focus on habitats most important to waterfowl; including the restoration of duck breeding habitat in Canada and the northern central states, and also duck overwintering habitat, mostly in the coastal and southern states and in Mexico. </p>
        
        <h2>Regions of Special Interests</h2>
    <p>There are several regions throughout the US and Canada where UD takes a special interest in the wildlife:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Prairie Pothole Region</li>
            <li>Western Boreal Forest of Canada</li>
            <li>Mississippi Alluvial Valley</li>
            <li>Central Valley and Coastal California</li>
            <li>Gulf Coastal Prairie</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Ducks Unlimited Canada (DUC) was on hand Wednesday to hear an announcement of $31 million from the Alberta government to support wetland conservation and restoration. The announcement was made by the Honourable Robin Campbell, minister of Environment and Sustainable Resource Development at the Bow Habitat Station in Calgary.</p>
        <h3>Ducks In Canada</h3>
        <p>The Nottawasaga Valley Conservation Authority (NVCA) and Ducks Unlimited Canada (DUC) encourage all landowners, contractors and habitat restoration professionals interested in restoring wetlands to mark their calendars for July 3, 2014. The two organizations are joining forces to host an exciting, informative and free Workshop on Wetlands, 6:30-9:00 p.m. at the Tiffin Centre, 8195 8th Line, Utopia, near Barrie. The main goals of DU begin with the following:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt><em>Restoring Grassland</em></dt>
                <dd>Grassland cover helps hens conceal their nests and increases their chances of successfully hatching a clutch, as well as increases sexual productivity and heightens the chance of producing offspring.</dd>
            <dt><em>Replanting Forests</em></dt>
                <dd>Forests that flood regularly due to overflowing riverbanks, such as the bottomland hardwood forests in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley make for ideal wintering habitat for ducks, and provide essential breeding and foraging habitat for other wildlife species. However, 80% of these forests have been cleared and natural flooding has been reduced by 50–90%.</dd>
            <dt><em>Restoring Watersheds</em></dt>
                <dd>When watersheds are disturbed, contaminants wash into wetlands and disrupt the plants, fish and animals. DU restores drained wetlands, protects stream corridors and establishes buffer strips that filter nutrients and silt.</dd>
            <dt><em>Educating Landowners</em></dt>
                <dd>FDU works with farmers, ranchers and other landowners to improve the agricultural and recreational value of their land while making it more wildlife-friendly.</dd>
            <dt><em>Conservation Easements</em></dt>
                <dd>Conservation easements protect the natural resource values of a property in perpetuity. The landowner maintains actual ownership of the land, but agrees to certain development restrictions. Since 75% of U.S. wetlands are on private property, conservation easements play a crucial role in the conservation movement.</dd>
            <dt><em>Acquiring Land</em></dt>
                <dd>The direct purchase of wetlands to restore and protect it. Once restoration is complete, DU generally sells or donates the property to a group or agency that will manage it for wildlife.</dd>
        </dl>
        Ducks Unlimited is also working closely with government leaders, conservation leaders, private landowners, and farmers to ensure that environmental provisions are contained in the 2012 Farm Bill. The Farm Bill supports programs such as the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP).
        <h2>More About the Workshop</h2>
        <h3>Participants</h3>
        <p>Workshop participants will learn about restoration techniques, how to enhance shorelines, stream-banks and ponds for fish and wildlife. Participants will be the first to learn about a new grant program that will run until March 31, 2017, and may cover 50-90% of costs for wetland projects that qualify. Project examples include wetland restoration, wetland creation, livestock exclusion fencing and nest boxes.</p>
        <h3>The Ecosystem</h3>
        <p>Wetlands are rich ecosystems that provide an incredible range of benefits. They help control flooding, improve water quality and have rich biodiversity of species, just to name a few. </p>
        <p>In much of southern Ontario, wetlands are under the stewardship of private landowners. There are many simple projects that can be done to help benefit these critical ecosystems. To assist landowners in protecting, restoring and creating functional wetlands, DUC, NVCA, the Lake Simcoe Region Conservation Authority and the Severn Sound Environmental Association have teamed-up to form a Wetland Collaborative. </p>

        <h4>Another Year of Record High Duck Numbers</h4>
        <p>Every year, the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS) and Canadian Wildlife Service (CWS) team up to survey duck populations and habitats on both sides of the border. The release of their findings is always eagerly anticipated by duck enthusiasts throughout North America, including Ducks Unlimited Canada (DUC) supporters. This year, the results revealed some encouraging news as well as some troubling trends to keep an eye on.</p>
        <p>After a delayed migration - likely due to a winter that just wouldn’t quit in many areas — a total of 49.2 million ducks were estimated in their traditional North American breeding areas this year. This is a record high, reaching 8 per cent above 2013 numbers and 43 per cent above the 1993-2013 long-term average (LTA).</p>

        <p>With a few exceptions, population estimates for each duck species were very encouraging:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Mallards have increased by 5 per cent since last year and by 42 per cent compared to the LTA</li>
            <li>Green-winged teal populations sit at 13 and 69 percent above 2013 estimates and the LTA, respectively</li>
            <li>Blue-winged teal populations are 10 per cent higher than last year and 75 per cent over the LTA</li>
            <li>One of the largest increases was observed in northern shovelers, which jumped above the 2013 estimate and LTA by 11 and 114 per cent, respectively</li>
            <li>Gadwall populations have also more than doubled compared to the LTA (102 per cent above), and are 14 per cent higher than last year</li>
            <li>Redhead populations have increased by 6 per cent since last year and are 85 per cent above the LTA</li>
            <li>CCanvasback populations decreased by 13 per cent since last year but remain well above (18 per cent) their LTA</li>
            <li>Scaup have increased by 11 per cent since last year but remain 8 per cent below their LTA</li>
            <li>Of concern, northern pintail have decreased by 3 per cent since last year and are 20 per cent below their LTA.</li>
        </ol>
